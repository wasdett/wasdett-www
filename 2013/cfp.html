<h1>Call for papers</h1>

<p>The WASDeTT workshop series is motivated by the observation that
  tools and tool building play an important role in applied academic
  software engineering research. Tools are both the tangible results of research
  projects, and -more and more- tools serve the purpose of laboratory and field instruments.</p>

<p>While tool building is popular it is hard to do right. For a tool to actual reach its goal, validating theory or observing reality, a significant engineering and intellectual investment is required.</p>

<p>Given the importance of tool building and the
  significant challenges associated with it, our workshop allows interested
  researchers to share their tool building experiences and to explore
  how tools can be constructed more effectively and efficiently. </p>

<p>The purpose of WASDeTT is to gather researchers working on different tools, providing a forum where 
they can talk about common issues relevant to all tool builders, and builders of
  academic research prototypes in particular. <em>Users</em> of academic tools from <em>industry</em> are also very welcome to join. Like previous WASDeTT instances, this one also prepares for an Experimental Software and Toolkits (EST) special issue of Elsevier&#39;s Science in Computer Programming journal, where tool construction results are disseminated.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Keywords</em>: tool development, software analysis and transformation, visualization, test-case generation, metrics, security analysis, profiling, debugging, persistence, aspect weaving, frameworks, model checking, compilers, static analysis, source-to-source transformation, programming language extensions, domain-specific languages, mining software repositories, plugin architectures, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Domains</em>: WASDeTT intentionally crosscuts different topics and domains: tools are relevant everywhere. We also solicit meta discussions on tool development and validation.</p></li>
<li><p>We invite you to submit either or both of these two different kinds of papers:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tool design papers</strong> - 10 pages, excluding screen shots. These present an (academic) tool and discuss how
the tool was built. Next to a clear positioning to <em>related research</em>, and <em>related tools</em>, the paper should address issues such as the <em>requirements</em>, the <em>rationale</em> for the important design decisions, and <em>lessons learned</em> from the experience of implementing the chosen design. </li>
<li><strong>Position papers</strong> - 5 pages, all inclusive. These state a position or vision on issues
related to tool building. Importantly, such a paper should serve as
a foundation for interesting discussions at the workshop. The papers are judged by normal academic standards in terms of motivation, clarity and related work.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Requirements</em>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Submissions should be formatted according in Elsevier&#39;s SCP style. </li>
<li>the authors of the accepted papers are required to participate in the workshop by presenting their paper and taking part in the discussions. Notes of the discussions are published online after the workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Publication</em>: all accepted papers are included in the hand-out proceedings at the workshop. The <em>tool design papers</em> are further eligable for submission to the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/%7Emvdbrand/SCP-EST/">EST special issue</a> in <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/">Science of Computer Programming</a></p></li>
