# WASDeTT-4
===========

WASDeTT-4 is one of the workshops at [ECOOP/ECSA/ECMFA](http://www.lirmm.fr/ec-montpellier-2013/), organized on July 1st, 2013, in Montpellier, France.

# Description

 The WASDeTT workshop series is motivated by the observation that
  tools and tool building play an important role in applied academic
  software engineering research. Tools are both the tangible results of research
  projects, and -more and more- tools serve the purpose of laboratory and field instruments.

  While tool building is popular it is hard to do right. For a tool to actual reach its goal, validating theory or observing reality, a significant engineering and intellectual investment is required.

  Given the importance of tool building and the
  significant challenges associated with it, our workshop allows interested
  researchers to share their tool building experiences and to explore
  how tools can be constructed more effectively and efficiently.

The purpose of WASDeTT is to gather researchers working on different tools, providing a forum where
they can talk about common issues relevant to all tool builders, and builders of
  academic research prototypes in particular. Like previous WASDeTT instances, this one also prepares for an Experimental Software and Toolkits (EST) special issue of Elsevier's Science in Computer Programming journal, where tool construction results are disseminated.

# Topics and keywords

The nature of WASDeTT is cross-cutting different topics and domains, approaching all these topics from the tool development perspective. The following list of keywords is an indication of the kinds of topics we expect, but should not be taken as a restriction. Note that this topic list intentionally overlaps with the topics from the ECOOP 2013 call for papers.

 - tool development
 - software analysis and transformation
 - visualization
 - test-case generation
 - metrics
 - security analysis
 - profiling
 - debugging
 - persistence
 - aspect weaving
 - frameworks
 - model checking
 - compilers
 - static analysis
 - source-to-source transformation
 - programming language extensions
 - domain-specific languages
 - mining software repositories
 - plugin architectures
 - etc.

WASDeTT intentionally crosscuts different topics and domains: tools are relevant everywhere. We also solicit meta discussions on tool development and validation.
